Tech Used
  Bootstrap jquery plug in scrollnav for scroll feature

  Most challenging, surprisingly getting lightbox to work obviously
  i started to code it and would finish that next.

  Process was to figure out how Bootstrap works as it was my first endeavor in
  bootstrap. I have been looking forward to using it. To further utilize Bootstrap,
  I used it to stylize my nav and for columns throughout the html. I then made my forms.
  I like seeing the structure of my page early even if its minimal elements.
I then went into thinking about my testimonials and how I would do them.


  Unfinished, styling my css to make page look more professional. Adding more
  intuitive functionality to form and different sections. Adding a skill bar
  using css/jquery animations which is what I wanted to originally do before using fa icons.
